# PHPCBF Support Roadmap

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding PHPCBF (PHP Code Beautifier
and Fixer) support to vscode-phpcs.

---

## User-Facing Features

### v1 Scope (File-Level Fixes)

#### 1. Quick Fix Code Actions ✅

When a user clicks on a PHPCS diagnostic (squiggly line), they'll see:

- **"Fix all auto-fixable issues in this file (PHPCBF)"** - Run PHPCBF on entire file ✅

This appears in:

- The lightbulb menu (Cmd/Ctrl + .) ✅
- Right-click context menu under "Quick Fix..." ✅
- The Problems panel (click on diagnostic → Quick Fix) ✅

#### 2. Commands (Command Palette) ✅

- **"PHPCS: Fix this file with PHPCBF"** - Fix current file ✅
- **"PHPCS: Fix all files in workspace with PHPCBF"** - Fix all PHP files (with confirmation/progress) ✅

#### 3. Format on Save Integration ✅

Optional setting to auto-fix on save:

```json
{
  "phpcs.phpcbfOnSave": true
}
```

#### 4. Status Bar Feedback

Show progress indicator when PHPCBF is running (especially for workspace-wide fixes). ❌ (not yet implemented)

### Future Enhancements (Post-v1)

These features are deferred until v1 is stable:

- **Single diagnostic fixes** - Fix only the specific violation at cursor
- **Diff preview** - Show changes before applying (optional setting)
- **Document formatter registration** - Register as VS Code's document formatter
  (lowest priority, may not implement)

## New Settings (v1) ✅

| Setting                      | Type    | Default | Description                                       | Status |
| ---------------------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| `phpcs.phpcbfEnable`         | boolean | `true`  | Enable/disable PHPCBF integration                 | ✅     |
| `phpcs.phpcbfExecutablePath` | string  | `null`  | Path to phpcbf executable (auto-detected if null) | ✅     |
| `phpcs.phpcbfOnSave`         | boolean | `false` | Auto-fix on save                                  | ✅     |

## Technical Architecture

### New Files

```text
phpcs-server/src/
├── fixer.ts              # PhpcbfFixer class (mirrors PhpcsLinter) ✅
├── fixer-utils.ts        # Utility functions for PHPCBF operations ✅
└── code-actions.ts       # Code action provider logic (file-level fixes) ✅

phpcs-server/test/
├── fixer.test.ts         # Integration tests for fixer ❌ (not yet created)
├── fixer-utils.test.ts   # Unit tests for utilities ✅
└── code-actions.test.ts  # Unit tests for code actions ✅
```

### Key Integration Points

1. **server.ts**: Add `codeActionProvider` capability and `onCodeAction` handler ✅
2. **settings.ts**: Add PHPCBF settings to interface ✅
3. **phpcs/package.json**: Add configuration properties ✅
4. **strings.ts**: Add PHPCBF-related error messages ✅

---

## Implementation Phases (v1)

### Phase 1: Core PHPCBF Execution ✅

**Goal**: Basic PHPCBF execution that can fix a file

1. Create `fixer.ts` with `PhpcbfFixer` class ✅
   - Factory method to create fixer (detect phpcbf path) ✅
   - `fix(document, settings)` method that runs PHPCBF ✅
   - Version detection (reuse PHPCS version since they're bundled together) ✅

2. Create `fixer-utils.ts` with utility functions ✅
   - `buildFixArguments()` - Build CLI arguments for PHPCBF ✅
   - `parseFixResult()` - Parse PHPCBF output/exit codes ✅
   - Exit codes: 0 = no issues, 1 = issues fixed, 2 = unfixable issues, 3 = both ✅

3. Add settings to `settings.ts` ✅

4. Add unit tests for utilities ✅

### Phase 2: File-Level Code Actions ✅

**Goal**: Quick fix action to address all issues in a file

1. Create `code-actions.ts` with code action logic ✅
   - Generate "Fix all issues in this file" action when diagnostics exist ✅

2. Update `server.ts` ✅
   - Add `codeActionProvider: true` to capabilities ✅
   - Implement `onCodeAction` handler ✅
   - Execute PHPCBF and apply text edits (full file replacement) ✅

3. Re-lint after fix to refresh diagnostics ✅

### Phase 3: Commands, Workspace Fixes, and Auto-Fix ✅

**Goal**: Command palette integration, workspace-wide fixes, and format-on-save

1. Register commands in extension ✅
   - "Fix this file" command ✅
   - "Fix all files in workspace" command ✅

2. Implement workspace-wide fixes ✅
   - Find all PHP files in workspace ✅
   - Show progress indicator during operation ✅
   - Report summary (X files fixed, Y errors, etc.) ✅

3. Implement auto-fix on save ✅
   - Hook into `onWillSave` event ✅
   - Run PHPCBF before save based on setting ✅

4. Add status bar integration ❌
   - Show "Fixing..." indicator during operations ❌

### Phase 4: Polish and Edge Cases (Partial)

**Goal**: Robust error handling and user experience

1. Handle edge cases
   - PHPCBF not installed/not found ✅
   - File has syntax errors (PHPCBF can't fix) ✅
   - Concurrent fix requests ❌
   - Large files / timeout handling ❌

2. Documentation ✅
   - Update README with PHPCBF features ✅
   - Add configuration examples ✅

---

## Future Phases (Post-v1)

### Single Diagnostic Fixes

- Add "Fix this issue" action for individual diagnostics
- May require running PHPCBF with line-specific options or `--dry-run` analysis

### Diff Preview

- Add `phpcs.phpcbfShowDiff` setting
- Show changes in diff view before applying
- Allow user to accept/reject

### Document Formatter Registration

- Register as `DocumentFormattingEditProvider`
- Allow "Format Document" command to use PHPCBF
- Lowest priority - may not implement

---

## PHPCBF Execution Details

### Command Structure

```bash
phpcbf --stdin-path=<file> --standard=<standard> --encoding=UTF-8 -
```

- Input: File content via stdin (same as PHPCS)
- Output: Fixed file content to stdout

### Exit Codes

Exit codes have different meanings in v3 vs v4. See the
[official documentation](https://github.com/PHPCSStandards/PHP_CodeSniffer/wiki/Advanced-Usage#understanding-the-exit-codes)
for details.

**PHPCBF v3.x:**

| Code | Meaning                                  |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 0    | no fixable errors, nothing was fixed     |
| 1    | all fixable errors were fixed correctly  |
| 2    | phpcbf failed to fix some fixable errors |
| 3    | processing error                         |

**PHPCBF v4.0.0+ (cumulative/bitmask):**

| Code | Meaning                                               |
| ---- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| 0    | clean code base / auto-fixed with no issues remaining |
| 1    | issues found/remaining, auto-fixable                  |
| 2    | issues found/remaining, non-auto-fixable              |
| 4    | failure to fix some files/fixer conflict              |
| 5    | 1 + 4: auto-fixable issues with some fix failures     |
| 7    | 1 + 2 + 4: mixed issues with some fix failures        |
| 16   | processing error blocking the run                     |
| 64   | requirements not met (e.g., minimum PHP version)      |

**Note**: In v4+, the `ignore_non_auto_fixable_on_exit` config option can make
PHPCBF return exit code 0 even when non-fixable issues remain. This is useful
for CI/CD automation. We use content comparison to detect actual changes
regardless of exit code.

### Applying Fixes

Use LSP's `TextEdit` to replace entire file content:

```typescript
{
  range: fullDocumentRange,
  newText: fixedContent
}
```

Or use `WorkspaceEdit` for batch operations:

```typescript
connection.workspace.applyEdit({
  changes: {
    [uri]: [textEdit],
  },
});
```

## Considerations

### PHPCBF Path Resolution

PHPCBF is typically bundled with PHPCS:

- Same directory as `phpcs` executable
- Composer: `vendor/bin/phpcbf`
- Global: `/usr/local/bin/phpcbf`

Reuse existing path resolution logic, just swap `phpcs` → `phpcbf`.

### Fixable vs Non-Fixable Violations

Not all PHPCS violations can be auto-fixed. For v1, we use the **optimistic approach**:

- Offer "Fix all issues" action whenever any diagnostics exist
- PHPCBF will fix what it can and skip unfixable violations
- User sees remaining diagnostics after fix is applied

This is simple and works well for file-level fixes. Single diagnostic fixes (post-v1)
may need `--dry-run` analysis to determine fixability.

### Concurrent Requests

If user triggers multiple fixes quickly:

- Queue requests
- Cancel pending if new request comes in
- Or debounce fix operations

---

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

- `fixer-utils.test.ts`: Test argument building, result parsing
- Mock PHPCBF responses for various scenarios

### Integration Tests

- `fixer.test.ts`: Test actual PHPCBF execution (requires PHPCBF installed)
- Test with intentionally broken PHP files
- Verify fixes are applied correctly

### Manual Testing

- Test quick fix actions in VS Code
- Test "Fix this file" command
- Test "Fix all files in workspace" command
- Test format-on-save
- Test with various coding standards
- Test error scenarios (syntax errors, missing PHPCBF)
